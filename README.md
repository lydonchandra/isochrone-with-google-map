DEMO: http://sandropaganotti.com/wp-content/goodies/demos/isochrone/index.html

This script uses Google Maps API to generate a isochrone (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line#Social_sciences);
it firstly invoke Geocoding service on a desired location (eg: Paris)
and then it cycles on some rays (you can decide how many) of the 
conference centered on that location. 

For each ray then the script marks a point corresponding to 
the distance (by car) in minutes specified as input (eg: 10 minutes) 
from the inputted location.
